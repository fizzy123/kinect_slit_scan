kinect_slit_scan
================

Application to do slit scan video via the Kinect

Very straightforward. If you have a kinect, you can hook it up and this application will apply a slitscan effect
to the video feed it recieves. Lots of fun. 

Requires Kinect Drivers.

Probably will update it to have more options and maybe depth based slit-scan.
